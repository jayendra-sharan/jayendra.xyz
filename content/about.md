# About Me

---

Hi, I’m Jay! I love experimenting with productivity—finding better ways to work, think, and organize life. I’m deep into _Getting Things Done (GTD)_ and always testing tools like _Notion_ for structure, _Freedom_ for focus, and _NetNewsWire_ to stay updated. But no matter how digital things get, I always carry a notebook. Some thoughts just need ink.

Photography is my way of slowing down. I shoot only in black and white, drawn to the simplicity and depth it brings to street photography. There’s something raw and timeless about it—no distractions, just moments as they are.

Music is a constant companion. My playlist moves from _Bob Marley_ to _Eminem_, _Bob Dylan_ to _Pink Floyd_, with _Noah and the Whale_ somewhere in between.

This site is my little corner of the internet, where I share thoughts on productivity, creativity, and the small details that make life interesting.
