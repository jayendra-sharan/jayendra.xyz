# Hi, I'm Jay

---

Curious about the world, always experimenting—whether it’s how we work, the tools we use, or the moments we capture. I like simplicity but appreciate the little details that make life interesting.

By day, I’m a front-end engineer, building and creating on the web. Outside of work, you’ll find me with a camera in hand, capturing the world in black and white—one street at a time.
